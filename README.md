This repository is the **public infrastructure home** for BIU.G Academy: static website, institutional documentation, governance artifacts, and execution roadmaps. It is intended for regulators, NGOs, universities, developers, and institutional partners who need a clear, inspectable record of what exists today versus what is planned.

---

## Project overview

BIU.G Academy is an **Angola-first**, **offline-first** technical education and training initiative **under development** by Biu-g Holdings LLC. The initiative focuses on practical financial literacy, digital readiness, entrepreneurship foundations, technical pathways, and long-term workforce capability—without presenting future systems as already operational.

This is **not** a licensed university repository and **does not** confer accredited academic degrees.

---

## Mission

Develop disciplined, accessible learning infrastructure that strengthens real-economy skills for Angola and, over time, contributes to broader African digital readiness—through documentation, cohort-based delivery (planned), and transparent governance.
