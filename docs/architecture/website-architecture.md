# Website architecture

## Current system (live)

```
Browser
   │
   ▼
GitHub Pages (static)
   │
   ├── HTML (localized: /pt/, /en/, /fr/)
   ├── css/styles.css
   ├── js/script.js
   └── assets/ (logo, images)
```

**Characteristics:**

- No server-side rendering in production
- No build toolchain required for deployment
- Custom domain via `CNAME` → `biugacademy.org`

## Public routes

### Localized primary pages

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `/` | Redirect to default locale (`/pt/`) |
| `/pt/`, `/en/`, `/fr/` | Home |
| `*/sobre/` · `*/about/` | About |
| `*/como-funciona/` · `*/how-it-works/` | How it works |
| `*/entrar-primeira-turma/` · waitlist aliases | Cohort application |
| `*/candidatura-recebida/` · thank-you aliases | Confirmation |

### Institutional aliases (root)

| Path | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `about/` | Redirect to localized about |
| `programs/` | Program / home redirect |
| `platform/` | Platform orientation |
| `waitlist/` | Redirect to cohort intake |
| `thank-you/` | Redirect to confirmation |

Documentation refers to **`apply/`** as the logical application route; implementation today uses `waitlist.html` and `/pt/entrar-primeira-turma/`.

## Intake (current)

Application forms may submit to external bridges (for example Google Apps Script) documented under `google-apps-script/`. Submissions are **not** processed by GitHub Pages itself.

## Non-production components

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `backend/` | Experimental; not part of Pages deploy |
| AI classification | Not production (see [future-ai-backend.md](future-ai-backend.md)) |
