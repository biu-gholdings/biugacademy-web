# Future AI backend (planned)

## Status

**Not deployed in production.** Any experimental prompts or scripts in `backend/` are research-only until promoted on [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) Phase 4.

## Intended role (assistive only)

AI tooling is being **designed** to support human reviewers—not to autonomously admit or reject candidates.

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Signal extraction | Summarize application text into structured tags |
| Consistency checks | Flag incomplete or contradictory answers |
| Routing hints | Suggest track fit for reviewer confirmation |
| Coach content (future) | Optional learning assistance with clear boundaries |

## Architecture sketch (planned)

```
Application record (database)
        │
        ▼
Classification service (policy-bound prompts + rules)
        │
        ▼
Reviewer dashboard (human decision)
        │
        ▼
Cohort selection outcome (logged)
```

## Safeguards (required before launch)

- Human-in-the-loop for all admission decisions
- Bias and fairness review for training data and prompts
- No automated denial without appeal path
- PII minimization in model inputs
- Logging without raw sensitive data retention
- Clear applicant disclosure where AI assists review

## What we will not claim

- “AI admissions engine” as a finished product today
- Guaranteed matching to employment or income
- Autonomous credential issuance
